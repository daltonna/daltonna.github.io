<p> Desktop Defender is a game I created with four other students as part of EECS 494: Game Development at the University of Michigan. Our studio name is <i>Sprinting Quokkas</i>
  The Game is a retro asymmetrical multiplayer game where players are tasked with defending their computer from invading viruses. One player controls the cursor, while the other controls the antivirus with a controller. At the EECS 494 Game Showcase, Desktop Defender was voted the 6th most popular game of the 21 games being shown. 
  Links to other games as well as Desktop Defender can be found below.
