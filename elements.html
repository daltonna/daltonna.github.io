										<h2>EECS 481 at The University of Michigan</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										This course teaches the fundamentals of software engineering with a focus on five core topics: Measurement and Risk, Quality Assurance, Software Defects, Software Design, and Productivity at Scale. These concepts are taught through six projects, beginning with generating high coverage test suites and ending with making a contribution to an open-source codebase.
									</p>
									<p>
										The course uses many different tools and libraries in the assignments throughout the semester. Some of the most notable are <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">Gcov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cobertura/">Cobertura</a> for test coverage,
										<a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop</a> and <a href="https://www.evosuite.org/">Evosuite</a> for test input generation. Lastly, we used static analysis tools <a href="https://www.grammatech.com/codesonar-cc">GrammaTech's CodeSonar</a> and <a href="https://fbinfer.com/">Facebook/Meta's Infer</a> as static analysis tools to detect potential defects in various subject programs.

											<h4>Test Coverage</h4>
											<p>
												The first assignment focuses on generating a high-coverage test suite for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libpng">libpng</a> library. The test suite consists of PNG images that we selected or created. The goal for the assignment was to get >= 36% statement coverage. 
												Getting above 30% statement coverage was straightforward, but getting to 36% required us to be more creative with what images we included in our test suite. We eventually got 38% coverage by manually editing properties of the PNGs such as gamma values and shading properties.
											</p>
											<p>
												We started our server-side clone by creating a basic script to create the database that will make up the content of our website.
												<br/>
												After our data was finished, our main focus became implementing various GET and POST requests that clients would send when using the app.
												<br/>
												With GET requests, we were mainly fetching data from our database to display to the user by using SQLite to access our data and render it to the HTML template using Flask.
												<br/>
												POST requests were trickier to implement because we had to use information sent by the user to change our database--such as a user commenting on a post or liking a post. 
												Accessing information sent by the users was one of the more difficult aspects of this project early on.

												<h3>Original Game: Desktop Defender</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project was done over the course of 46 days, in a group of five students. Similar to the retro remaster, we started by finishing our most challenging mechanic. 
												For us, the mechanic we started with was spawning enemies. After workshopping different ideas, we settled on a bullet-hell style 2D Arena shooter where the players progress through rounds to advance.
											</p>
											<p>
												One of the defining characteristics of our game was the cooperative nature of it. One player must protect the other from losing all of their health or else the round ends and the players must restart.
												Our main way of getting feedback on our game was through playtesting, whether with other students in the course or outside of class with family and friends. One of the main pieces of feedback we got was the need for more upgrades and weapons to keep the gameplay fresh and interesting for the players.
											</p>
											<p>
												The development of Desktop Defender taught me many things about game development, such as the iterative design cycle, how to properly playtest, and how to make a great game by keeping the scope of it limited. 
												But my main takeaway from the course is that many resources go into developing a game, not just from the developer's side. If a game is missing music or art direction, it can be a largely hollow experience for the player, so it's important to not get tunnel vision in terms of what aspect of development needs the most attention.
