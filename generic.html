										This course teaches the fundamentals of web development in a five project sequence, starting with a static site generated with Jinja HTML templates, and finishing with the creation of a search engine using the MapReduce algorithm implemented in the previous project.
									</p>
									<p>
										The course uses common tools used in the industry such as SQLite, Jinja, Flask, and React. After completing the static site, we implemented server-side dynamic webpages and client-side dynamic webpages for our second and third projects respectively.

												<h3>Server-Side Dynamic Pages</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The first three projects are designed around implementing an Instagram clone in three different ways: 
												a static clone using Jinja2 templates, a server-side dynamic clone using Flask, and finally a client-side dynamic clone using Flask and React.
											</p>
											<p>
												We started our server-side clone by creating a basic script to create the database that will make up the content of our website.
												<br/>
												After our data was finished, our main focus became implementing various GET and POST requests that clients would send when using the app.
												<br/>
												With GET requests, we were mainly fetching data from our database to display to the user by using SQLite to access our data and render it to the HTML template using Flask.
												<br/>
												POST requests were trickier to implement because we had to use information sent by the user to change our database--such as a user commenting on a post or liking a post. 
												Accessing information sent by the users was one of the more difficult aspects of this project, especially early on.
											</p>
											<p>
												We started our client-side clone by implementing a basic REST API for handling all of the

												Much of the Client-Side code used the code from Server-Side pages as a foundation. We started our client-side clone by implementing a basic REST API for handling all of the

												One of the defining characteristics of our game was the cooperative nature of it. One player must protect the other from losing all of their health or else the round ends and the players must restart.
												Our main way of getting feedback on our game was through playtesting, whether with other students in the course or outside of class with family and friends. One of the main pieces of feedback we got was the need for more upgrades and weapons to keep the gameplay fresh and interesting for the players.
											</p>
											<p>
												The development of Desktop Defender taught me many things about game development, such as the iterative design cycle, how to properly playtest, and how to make a great game by keeping the scope of it limited. 
												But my main takeaway from the course is that many resources go into developing a game, not just from the developer's side. If a game is missing music or art direction, it can be a largely hollow experience for the player, so it's important to not get tunnel vision in terms of what aspect of development needs the most attention.
											</p>
											<p>
												Special thank you to Ryan Albert, Marshal Chen, Keiwei Han, and Alexander Kalams, my group for this project. I will always look back fondly on the twelve hour workdays spent debugging before a deadline, despite how difficult those days were.
